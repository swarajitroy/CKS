# Setup appropriate OS Leve security domains - PodSecurityPolicies, OPA, SecurityContext

## SecurityContext
---

A security context defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container. It can be added in the Pod specification at a Pod spec level or Container level. These are some of the important facets on Security Context,

1. Discretionary Access Control: Permission to access an object, like a file, is based on user ID (UID) and group ID (GID).
2. Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux): Objects are assigned security labels.
3. Running as privileged or unprivileged.
4. Linux Capabilities: Give a process some privileges, but not all the privileges of the root user.
5. AppArmor: Use program profiles to restrict the capabilities of individual programs.
6. Seccomp: Filter a process's system calls.
7. AllowPrivilegeEscalation: Controls whether a process can gain more privileges than its parent process. This bool directly controls whether the no_new_privs flag gets set on the container process. AllowPrivilegeEscalation is true always when the container is: 1) run as Privileged OR 2) has CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
8. readOnlyRootFilesystem: Mounts the container's root filesystem as read-only.
